Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It′s alright
I don′t wanna leave her now
You know I believe and how
I′d like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
Love, love me do
You know, I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do
It′s been a hard day's night
And I′ve been working like a dog
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
