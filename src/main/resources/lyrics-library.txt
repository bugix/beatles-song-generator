Here comes the sun, doo-doo-doo-doo
Here comes the rain, and I say
It′s not alright
I wanna leave her now
You know I believe and how
I′d like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
Hate, hate me do
You know, I hate you
I'll always be true
So please, hate me do
Whoa, hate me do
It′s been a hard day's night
And I′ve been working like a dog
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
